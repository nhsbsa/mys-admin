              <p>Use this service to complete your Community Pharmacy Assurance Framework (CPAF).</p>

              <p>We need to assure ourselves that all services commissioned by the NHS are of consistent high quality. The CPAF Screening Questionnaire is a short self-assessment tool to help us identify which pharmacies we will ask to provide further assurance by completing the full CPAF to provide evidence they meet their terms of service and decide whether to arrange a contract monitoring visit.</p>

                            <p>All pharmacies will be asked to complete this questionnaire. Many of the questions are the same as last year however two have been retired and two new questions added. We will look at this together with information from other sources to select pharmacies we are considering for contract monitoring visits.</p>
                            <p>If your pharmacy is being considered for a full monitoring visit you will be requested to complete and return the full Community Pharmacy Assurance Framework (CPAF) pre visit questionnaire. However both PSNC and NHS England recommend that all Pharmacy contractors make use of the full CPAF pre visit questionnaire to assure themselves that they are compliant with Terms of Service as set out in the NHS (Pharmaceutical and Local Pharmaceutical) Regulations 2013.</p>
                            <p>The questions asked in this assessment questionnaire are indicators of the level of compliance with the terms of service. Contractors should also satisfy themselves that they are compliant with the terms of service, which are set out in Schedule 4 of:</p>
